## About Win32API: ##

Win32API is a plugin for 4th Dimension that lets your Windows applications take advantage of Windows-specific features that are not exposed by native 4th Dimension commands. Win32API lets you set a custom icon for any window, change the name of your 4D application in the title bar and task bar, customize file open and save dialogs, get information from the Regional Settings control panel, and much more.

Win32API is provided free of charge to the 4D developer community, with complete source code. A Macintosh stub is also included for cross-platform compiling.
